## ✅ **MonGuard Production Test Checklist**

This checklist outlines all **critical test areas** required to harden MonGuard for **real-world production deployment** — especially under load, failures, and scale.

---

### 🚨 1. Transaction Resilience

* [ ] Test rollback behavior on transaction failure (e.g., Mongo network error)
* [ ] Simulate session timeouts and validate recovery
* [ ] Ensure no partial writes or orphaned audit logs after rollback
* [ ] Validate data consistency after retry-on-failure scenarios

---

### ⚠️ 2. Database Connection & Fault Tolerance

* [ ] Simulate MongoDB connection drops mid-operation
* [ ] Test retry logic on timeout/network errors
* [ ] Test behavior when connection pool is exhausted
* [ ] Simulate replica set failover and observe retry/resume logic

---

### 🔁 3. Resource & Memory Management

* [ ] Measure memory usage with 10K+ large documents
* [ ] Validate cursor cleanup during paginated `find()` queries
* [ ] Run long-lived operations to detect memory leaks
* [ ] Monitor GC behavior under high concurrency

---

### 🧬 4. Data Validation & Schema Evolution

* [ ] Handle invalid or malformed `ObjectId` in queries
* [ ] Validate operations on corrupt or malformed documents
* [ ] Test schema version changes for backward compatibility
* [ ] Enforce required fields and reject missing/extra keys

---

### ⚙️ 5. Configuration & Runtime Safety

* [ ] Reject invalid `MonguardConfig` combinations
* [ ] Simulate misconfigured strategy factory resolution
* [ ] Test dynamic config updates (e.g., switch to fallback mode)
* [ ] Detect conflicts in audit collection names

---

### 📈 6. High-Load & Stress Scenarios

* [ ] Test bulk insert/update/delete with 10K+ documents
* [ ] Simulate concurrent writes from 50–100 clients
* [ ] Run sustained load test for 1–6 hours
* [ ] Apply memory pressure and observe recovery

---

### 🗂️ 7. Audit Log Durability & Consistency

* [ ] Simulate disk exhaustion for audit collection
* [ ] Corrupt audit entries and validate system behavior
* [ ] Test audit log archival and cleanup logic
* [ ] Validate audit behavior on sharded collections

---

### 🧪 Suggested Specialized Tests

* [ ] **Transaction Stress Test** – long-running + conflicting operations
* [ ] **Network Partition Simulation** – mid-operation disconnect
* [ ] **Chaos Injection** – random failures, latency, CPU/mem spikes
* [ ] **Schema Compatibility Matrix** – old clients + new schema
* [ ] **Audit Log Recovery Test** – crash → recovery → audit consistency

---

> 🧠 **Reminder**: Existing unit tests cover basic logic — but **these tests will catch bugs that only appear under production pressure** (scale, faults, misconfig, race conditions).
