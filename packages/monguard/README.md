**`monguard`** is a lightweight, zero-boilerplate toolkit designed to enhance MongoDB models with production-ready features:

* üóëÔ∏è **Soft Delete** ‚Äî Mark records as deleted without removing them from the database
* ‚è±Ô∏è **Auto Timestamps** ‚Äî Automatically manage `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields
* üïµÔ∏è **Audit Logging** ‚Äî Track every `create`, `update`, and `delete` action with detailed metadata
* üéØ **Delta Mode Auditing** ‚Äî Reduce audit log storage by 70-90% with smart field-level change tracking
* üöÄ **Transaction-Aware Auditing** ‚Äî In-transaction or outbox patterns for different consistency needs
* üß† **TypeScript First** ‚Äî Fully typed for safety and great DX
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Plug-and-Play** ‚Äî Minimal setup, maximum control

### ‚ú® Why `monguard`?

In real-world apps, deleting data is rarely the end of the story. Whether it's rollback, audit compliance, or just better traceability ‚Äî `monguard` has your back.

With just a single call, you can guard your collections against accidental data loss while keeping every change accountable.

### üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install monguard
```

### üîê Use-case Highlights

* CRM systems with user-deletable data
* E-commerce with order history tracking
* Admin dashboards needing full audit trail
* **Financial systems** requiring strict audit compliance
* **High-throughput applications** with eventual consistency needs
* Any app where "delete" doesn't really mean delete üòâ

> Guard your data. Track the truth. Sleep better.
> ‚Äî with **`monguard`** üõ°Ô∏è

## Installation

```bash
npm install monguard
# or
yarn add monguard
# or
pnpm add monguard
```

**Important**: You must install a MongoDB driver separately, as Monguard has zero runtime dependencies:

```bash
npm install mongodb
# or any MongoDB-compatible driver
```

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';
import { MonguardCollection, MonguardAuditLogger } from 'monguard';

// Define your document interface
interface User {
  _id?: any;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age?: number;
  createdAt?: Date;
  updatedAt?: Date;
  deletedAt?: Date;
  createdBy?: ObjectId;
  updatedBy?: ObjectId;
  deletedBy?: ObjectId;
}

// Connect to MongoDB
const client = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017');
await client.connect();
const db = client.db('myapp');

// Create audit logger with delta mode for 70-90% storage reduction
const auditLogger = new MonguardAuditLogger(db, 'audit_logs', {
  storageMode: 'delta',        // Enable delta mode
  maxDepth: 3,                 // Track nested changes up to 3 levels
  arrayDiffMaxSize: 20,        // Smart array handling
});

// Create a Monguard collection
const users = new MonguardCollection<User>(db, 'users', {
  auditLogger,
  concurrency: { transactionsEnabled: true },
  auditControl: {
    mode: 'inTransaction',     // Strong audit consistency
    failOnError: false         // Graceful error handling
  }
});

// Create a user with audit logging
try {
  const user = await users.create({
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com'
  }, {
    userContext: { userId: 'admin-123' }
  });
  
  console.log('User created:', user);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to create user:', error.message);
}
```
